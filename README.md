# PursuitOfHobbyness
## About the Project

"You never lose a dream, it just incubates as a hobby." â€“ Larry Page

Pursuit of Hobbyness is a web application that helps one pick a new hobby and make it a part of their lives.

The user is presented with six categories of hobbies to choose from, such as 
General, 
Sports and Outdoors, 
Collection, 
Observation, 
Education and 
Competition.

If and when the user clicks on category, they will be presented with a Hobby title and three buttons that are clickable. The buttons are - More Information, Search for a New Hobby and View Saved Hobbies.

The more information button will give the user a Wikipedia link that opens in a new tab on the browser for the user to read about the new hobby. If the user is happy to adopt their new hobby, they can choose to watch a collection of 6 videos that have been embedded on to the webpage.

The "search for a new hobby" button will take the user back to the start of the application, where the user can generate a new random hobby. 

The "View Saved Hobbies" button will give the user a list of hobbies they have searched for and should they be keen on exploring one of those hobbies again, they can choose to get more information.
